UI Lib made by me in 1 day, the module is currently on version 0.02

Module Version 0.04

This UI Lib was designed for me only, however I soon decided shortly after starting to develop the UI Lib, I wanted to make it public, however I do not plan to make it
open source at the moment.

This repository includes a license, if you are planning to make a copy of it, etc etc, then you'll want to read the rules of the license before doing so, or well: its
recommended.

The current license is Mozilla Public License 2.0
